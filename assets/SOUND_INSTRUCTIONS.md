# Success Sound Note

The app requires a success sound file at `assets/success.mp3`.

Since we cannot generate actual MP3 files programmatically, you have two options:

## Option 1: Download a free sound (Recommended)
1. Visit https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/success/ or https://freesound.org
2. Download a short, cheerful success sound (1-2 seconds)
3. Save it as `success.mp3` in the `assets` folder

## Option 2: Create a placeholder
The app will still work without the sound file. It will log an error to console but won't crash.
The visual success feedback (stars, "Good Job!" message) will still appear.

## Quick Sound Recommendation
Search for sounds like:
- "success chime"
- "reward sound"
- "achievement bell"
- "positive feedback"

Keep the file small (under 100KB) for fast loading.
