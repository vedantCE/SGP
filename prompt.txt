You are a senior React Native developer.

Build a SIMPLE, FULLY WORKING React Native app using Expo.
This app is only a prototype demo, not production-level.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use React Native + Expo
- Do NOT over-engineer
- Keep code simple and readable
- App must run immediately after `npm install` and `npm start`
- No backend
- No login
- No database
- No AI logic
- Only frontend interaction

APP GOAL:
Create a basic “Tracing Learning App” for children.
A child should be able to trace letters or numbers using touch or mouse.

FEATURES REQUIRED (MUST HAVE):

1. HOME SCREEN
- Title: “Trace & Learn”
- Two buttons:
  - “Trace Letters”
  - “Trace Numbers”

2. LETTER TRACING SCREEN
- Show a BIG dotted letter (example: capital letter A)
- Use SVG or Canvas-like drawing
- Allow user to draw on screen using:
  - finger (mobile)
  - mouse (laptop)
- User should trace over the dotted letter

3. SIMPLE SUCCESS LOGIC
- Do NOT implement complex accuracy math
- Just detect that the user has drawn something over the screen
- After sufficient drawing:
  - Show a success animation (stars / checkmark)
  - Play a happy sound
  - Show text: “Good Job!”

4. USER EXPERIENCE RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
- No red errors
- No negative feedback
- Only positive encouragement
- Smooth animation
- Calm colors
- Big UI elements (child-friendly)

5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Use Expo (latest stable)
- Use React Native components
- Use `react-native-svg` OR `expo-skia` for drawing
- Use `expo-av` for sound
- App must work on:
  - Android Emulator
  - Expo Go on real phone
  - Web preview (optional)

6. PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Proper folder structure
- Clear comments
- One main tracing component

7. README INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
At the end, include clear steps:
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the app
- How to open on phone using Expo Go

DO NOT:
- Add authentication
- Add unnecessary screens
- Add complex path-matching logic
- Add backend or APIs

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Provide FULL source code
- All required files
- App must be runnable immediately
- No pseudo-code
- No explanations outside code

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a senior React Native + Expo developer.

Modify the existing React Native (Expo) tracing app.

MAIN REQUIREMENT (VERY IMPORTANT):
Remove any manual Submit / Done button.
The app must AUTO-DETECT when the child finishes tracing a letter or number.

AUTO-COMPLETION LOGIC (KEEP IT SIMPLE):
- Track drawing activity (touch/mouse movement)
- Consider tracing COMPLETE when:
  - The user has been drawing continuously for at least 2–3 seconds
  - OR the number of drawn points/strokes exceeds a reasonable threshold
- Do NOT implement complex path-matching or geometry math
- The goal is a smooth prototype, not accuracy perfection

ON COMPLETION (MANDATORY UX BEHAVIOR):
- Immediately stop further drawing
- Trigger a joyful celebration:
  - Star burst / confetti / dancing animation
  - Soft, happy sound
- Show encouraging text:
  “Great Job!” or “Well Done!”
- No negative feedback
- No error messages
- No retry pressure

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use a lightweight approach:
  - Lottie animation OR
  - Simple scale + bounce animation using React Native Animated / Reanimated
- Animation should feel playful and rewarding for children
- Keep colors calm and friendly

USER EXPERIENCE RULES:
- Child should not have to think or click anything
- As soon as tracing feels finished, the app celebrates automatically
- This interaction should feel magical and satisfying

CODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Update only the tracing screen/component
- Keep code readable and commented
- Ensure the app still runs with:
  npm install
  npm start
- Must work on Expo Go (Android)

DO NOT:
- Add a Submit button
- Add strict accuracy validation
- Add backend or state persistence
- Add new screens unless required

OUTPUT:
Provide the updated, complete working code for the tracing logic
with auto-detection and celebration animation implemented.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT BUG FIX REQUIRED:

Currently, the tracing auto-completes even if the user only presses
and holds without actually tracing the letter.

Fix this behavior.

AUTO-COMPLETION MUST ONLY HAPPEN AFTER REAL TRACING.

Update the completion logic to require ALL of the following:

1. Movement Detection
- Detect actual finger/mouse movement
- A simple tap or long press must NOT count
- Completion logic should only start AFTER movement is detected

2. Minimum Drawing Coverage
- Require a minimum number of drawn points or strokes
- Example: total drawn points >= 80–120
- This ensures the child actually traced most of the letter

3. Time After Drawing Starts
- Start timing ONLY after real drawing movement begins
- Require at least 1.5–2 seconds of active drawing
- Do NOT count idle touch time

COMPLETION RULE:
Only trigger auto-complete when:
- The user has actively drawn
- Enough of the path is covered
- Enough drawing time has passed

ON SUCCESS:
- Stop drawing
- Trigger happy celebration animation
- Play cheerful sound
- Show positive message (“Great Job!”)

DO NOT:
- Auto-complete on press-and-hold
- Use only time-based logic
- Add manual submit buttons
- Add strict path accuracy math

Keep the solution simple, reliable, and child-friendly.
Ensure the app still runs correctly in Expo Go.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT BUG FIX + UX UPGRADE REQUIRED

There are two issues that must be fixed:

-----------------------------------
ISSUE 1: FALSE AUTO-COMPLETION
-----------------------------------

The tracing sometimes auto-completes even when the letter
is not actually traced properly.

Fix the auto-detection logic so that completion ONLY happens
after REAL, INTENTIONAL tracing.

Update the completion rules as follows:

Auto-complete must require ALL of these conditions:

1. Intentional Movement Detection
- Detect meaningful finger/mouse movement
- Ignore tap, press-and-hold, or tiny jitter

2. Minimum Distance Traveled (MANDATORY)
- Calculate total drawing distance
- Require a minimum distance threshold
  (example: total distance >= 600–1000 pixels)
- This ensures the child actually traced the letter

3. Minimum Drawing Points
- Require a reasonable number of points (example: 100+)

4. Time After Movement Starts
- Start timing ONLY after real movement begins
- Require at least 1.5–2 seconds of active drawing

Completion must NEVER trigger from time alone.

-----------------------------------
ISSUE 2: WEAK / MISSING CELEBRATION ANIMATION
-----------------------------------

Replace any basic animation with a PROPER, ATTRACTIVE celebration.

IMPLEMENT THIS:

- Use Lottie animation for celebration
- Example animations:
  - confetti
  - dancing star
  - happy success animation

ON SUCCESS:
- Disable drawing
- Dim background slightly
- Show a centered Lottie celebration animation
- Play cheerful success sound
- Display text: “Great Job!”

ANIMATION RULES:
- Animation should auto-play
- Large and visually exciting
- Child-friendly, colorful, joyful
- Must clearly feel like a reward

-----------------------------------
GENERAL RULES
-----------------------------------

- No Submit button
- No negative feedback
- No strict path accuracy math
- Keep logic simple but reliable
- Code must remain compatible with Expo Go
- App must still run with:
  npm install
  npm start

OUTPUT:
Provide updated working code implementing:
- Robust auto-detection logic
- Proper Lottie-based celebration animation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT RESET & FIX REQUIRED

The tracing completion logic has become too strict
and real letter tracing is no longer detected.

Fix this by SIMPLIFYING and RELAXING the logic.

--------------------------------
AUTO-DETECTION (PRIMARY)
--------------------------------

Implement SIMPLE and RELIABLE detection:

Auto-complete when ALL are true:
1. User has moved finger/mouse (not just tap)
2. Total drawn points >= 40
3. Total drawing distance >= 300 pixels

DO NOT:
- Use time-based conditions
- Use strict accuracy or geometry
- Require perfect tracing

This must reliably detect a normal traced letter A.

--------------------------------
SUBMIT BUTTON (SECONDARY / BACKUP)
--------------------------------

Add a soft “Done” button as a fallback.

Rules:
- Button is hidden initially
- Show the button ONLY if:
  - user has drawn something
  - auto-complete did not trigger after a few seconds

Button behavior:
- On press → mark as completed
- Trigger same success animation

--------------------------------
SUCCESS BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------

When completed (auto OR submit):

- Disable drawing
- Show Lottie celebration animation
- Play happy sound
- Display text “Great Job!”
- Ensure animation ALWAYS plays when completed === true

--------------------------------
UX RULES
--------------------------------

- Auto-detect should work most of the time
- Submit is only a safety net
- No frustration
- No strict validation
- Child must always be able to succeed

OUTPUT:
Provide updated working code
with relaxed detection + reliable celebration animation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT TO FIX AUTO-SUBMIT + OVERLAP

IMPORTANT FINAL CLEANUP REQUIRED

Two issues must be fixed:

--------------------------------
ISSUE 1: AUTO-SUBMIT NOT WORKING
--------------------------------

Auto-detection exists but submission only happens
when the Done button is clicked.

Fix this so that:

- Auto-detection is the PRIMARY completion method
- When auto-detection conditions are met,
  the app must immediately mark the tracing as completed
  WITHOUT requiring Done button click

The Done button must be a FALLBACK only.

Rules:
- Auto-detection should trigger completion first
- Done button should NOT block or override auto-detection
- Done button only helps if auto-detection fails

--------------------------------
ISSUE 2: OVERLAPPING SUCCESS ANIMATIONS
--------------------------------

Currently multiple success animations
(trophy + confetti/firecracker) appear together.

Fix this by:

- Using ONLY ONE success animation
- Keep ONLY the Trophy animation
- Remove or disable all other success animations

ANIMATION RULE:
- Trophy animation should render ONLY when completed === true
- Ensure it triggers once and does not overlap or duplicate

--------------------------------
FINAL SUCCESS FLOW
--------------------------------

Completion can happen by:
- Auto-detection OR
- Done button (fallback)

But BOTH must lead to:
- completed = true
- Drawing disabled
- ONLY Trophy animation shown
- Text: “Great Job!”

--------------------------------
UX RULES
--------------------------------

- Auto-submit should feel automatic and smooth
- No visual clutter
- One clear reward
- Child should feel calm and happy, not overwhelmed

OUTPUT:
Provide updated working code
with auto-submit restored
and single trophy animation only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT UX FEATURE FOR GUJARATI ADHD KIDS

This app is for Gujarati-medium children with ADHD.
English text-based instructions are NOT suitable.

Implement a friendly, child-like onboarding animation
before letter tracing starts.

--------------------------------
NEW FEATURE: CHARACTER INTRO ANIMATION
--------------------------------

When the child taps on a letter or number:

1. Show a short, full-screen animation (3–4 seconds)
2. Display a cute cartoon girl character
3. The character should smile and wave
4. Play Gujarati voice audio saying:

   “Chal!
    Aaje aapde aksharo lakhata shikhiye!”

5. After the animation ends, automatically transition
   to the tracing screen.

--------------------------------
ANIMATION IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------

- Use a Lottie animation for the girl character
- Keep animation playful, friendly, and calm
- No text on screen (voice only)
- Animation must auto-play once
- No skip button needed

--------------------------------
AUDIO REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

- Use pre-recorded Gujarati human voice audio (MP3)
- Play audio once during animation
- Use expo-av for sound playback

--------------------------------
UX RULES
--------------------------------

- No English instructions
- No reading required
- Voice + animation should guide the child
- Animation must be short and non-distracting
- Transition to tracing should feel smooth and automatic

--------------------------------
DO NOT
--------------------------------

- Add long animations
- Add English text
- Add buttons like “Continue”
- Add multiple characters

OUTPUT:
Provide updated working code
that adds this character intro animation
before tracing begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST

I have a Lottie animation file named `Cute tiger.json`.

Do NOT modify the Lottie JSON file itself.

Instead, implement the following:

--------------------------------
CHARACTER INTRO SCREEN
--------------------------------

1. Display the existing `Cute tiger.json` Lottie animation
   centered on the screen.

2. Overlay Gujarati text on top of the animation
   (like a speech bubble or caption):

   Text (Gujarati):
   “આજે આપણે અક્ષરો લખતા શીખીએ!”

3. Play Gujarati voice audio at the same time
   saying the same sentence.

--------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
--------------------------------

- Use LottieView for animation
- Use a Text component for Gujarati text overlay
- Position text clearly and child-friendly
- Use expo-av to play pre-recorded Gujarati MP3
- Animation and voice should auto-play
- Duration: 3–4 seconds only

--------------------------------
UX RULES
--------------------------------

- No English text
- No buttons
- No user interaction needed
- After animation finishes,
  automatically navigate to the tracing screen

--------------------------------
GOAL
--------------------------------

The child should feel like the tiger character
is welcoming them and speaking in Gujarati.

OUTPUT:
Provide working React Native Expo code
that integrates the Lottie animation,
Gujarati text overlay,
and Gujarati voice playback.
